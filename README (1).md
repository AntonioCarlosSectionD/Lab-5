Lab 5 Report  
Design choices
	The site was meant to show the three genres I listen to the most. It would be followed by artists from that genre. The last part of the page before the footer would be one song I listen to the most from them. Each section would utilize the “card” elements instead of regular flexboxes. I started the process by getting the color palette from Coolors. Afterwards, I took inspiration from the navbar I made in Assignment 1 to make the one for this lab’s page. The specific layout was designed so that the user can see a good path from genre to artist to song as they scroll down. I wanted the page to be very efficient with how it communicates information to the audience. As a result, information about each genre and artist was summarized into two to three sentences. A gradient was added to the background to simulate what it feels like to find more and more specific and niche information of a genre. To me, it feels like going down a tunnel or diving into the ocean, it starts off with the surface, what people usually see; to the darker parts, a place where there is information fewer and fewer people know. 

Development process
	After creating the background and header, I used the “relative” keyword on the footer to fix an issue I had on assignment one. There was still the issue of gaps in the margin from the footer. After moving on from that issue, I took care of the cards. I had an issue which involves them being aligned vertically instead of horizontally. The issue was because I put each card in its own separate container. It was fixed after I put each card in one container. I repeated the same code for each section. I used section IDs to link the sections to the navbar. Afterwards, I used media queries to alter the sizes and alignment of the cards when the size of the page changes. I made the minimum width of one query the minimum size of a laptop's screen. This layed out the cards horizontally, as intended. When the screen met the minimum width of a mobile screen, the cards were vertically aligned. The only issue is that the layout only changed when I shrunk the size of the window. It did not appear to be working when I tried to view it from a mobile screen. I made the header of the first section have a different size for the margin on the top because it had to get through the navbar first. The other two section headers had different containers so I could alter the margins of the top differently. Overall, an adequate job was done. There were still flaws but there are signs of improvement from the last lab.
